/**
 *  This is the Delta2 class.  A record represented in a Delta2 class is a list of changes to the /cves directory since the last git commit.
 *  This class is an refactoring of the older Delta class, with the following goals and features:
 *  1. store a simpler list, omitting information that can be assembled or accessed elsewhere (e.g., store just the CVE ID rather than the full path to the CVE in the github repository)
 *  2. separate changes in CVEs into categories for easier assessment of next steps for downstream users (e.g., cna-new, cna-updated, CISA-ADP, Secretariat-ADP, etc.)
 *  3. clarify what fetchTime means in all commands
 *  4. specify a Delta version number to help parsers
 *  5. minimize file storage since we have seen github's file size limits reached in the old deltaLog file
